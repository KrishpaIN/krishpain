                <p>

                    By default, your account is set to private and you are the only one who can see your profile and your data. There are three simple visibility options: Private, Shared or Public.
The default is Private, so your account starts off as completely private.
If people add you as a friend (and you accept), or you request that someone be your friend, they will be able to see your profile and all your weekly reports. Be careful when adding friends on the Service, and only accept people that you know and trust. If you do not wish to give them access to view your complete Tomorrow profile, then you should not accept their friend request.
If you decide to become part of an organization or a public community, members of this organization and this community will be able to see your profile and your weekly reports.
That said, some people may choose to make their page completely public and transparently share it with the world. We have designed most of the views of the Apps with this in mind, to analyze and share your stats in a way that is not embarrassing or dangerous. Public profiles can be viewed by anyone, and may occasionally be featured on our homepage and other parts of the Services.
Tomorrow staff can not view your profile, unless you share your data for testing or support purposes, but will never share anything not made public.
Even if you decide to share your data with us, we will never share or sell your details to any third-parties.
